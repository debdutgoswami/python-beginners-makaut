<strong>Sets</strong></br>
Set in Python is a data structure equivalent to sets in mathematics. It may consist of various elements; the order of elements in a set is undefined. You can add and delete elements of a set, you can iterate the elements of the set, you can perform standard operations on sets (union, intersection, difference).
